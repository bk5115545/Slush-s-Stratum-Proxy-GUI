Slush-s-Stratum-Proxy-GUI
=========================

Not entirely a GUI (yet) but it does make the output of Slush's Stratum Proxy look nicer.

You can use the mining_proxy.exe included in the jar or Slush's from his github.

As soon as I figure out how to add some picutres, I will.  
For now, just know that it does work, it is written in Java, and is completely cross platform.

Run jar using the following command:

java -cp proxy_gui.jar -jar proxy_gui.jar -o hostname -p port 

or if you would like to use your version of Slush's proxy, place the mining_proxy.exe next to the jar and then use the following command:

java -jar proxy_gui.jar

Supports all of Slush's command line options as well.  They are automatically passed to Slush's proxy when this program is started.


If this project becomes well funded (1BTC is all I need to break even), I will implement a much better frontend (looking at JCurses but some other libraries look promising).
I can do this project in about 11 programming languages so if you have a preference, let me know your preference and why please.
I can also make a web frontend if people would like one (relying on apache, mysql, and php5 of course).

I can add other coin addresses if you have an abundance of alt coins.  I'll take anything really...
